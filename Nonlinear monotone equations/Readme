In these methods, the functions PRPTTCGPM1, PRPTTCGPM2, PRPTTCGPM3, and PRPTTCGPM4 
called in the code represent JHYTTCGPM(1-4) in this paper, which is 
evident from the final plots. The program codes correspond accordingly, 
as demonstrated in the subsequent numerical experiments for image restoration.
